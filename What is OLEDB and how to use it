What is OLEDB 

The OLEDB libraries allow interaction with a number of target data files(Excel, CSV, Access) via a subset of SQL. 
Advantages: speed and efficiency in file handling without full loading the file into memory at a given time.

OLEDB stands for Object Linking and Embedding, database. It is an API designed by Microsoft that allows users to access a variety of data sources in a uniform manner. 

Pre Requisites

DLL installation  (Dynamic link library)
There are multiple versions of OLEDB library available. (Check programs and features within the control panel and look for Microsoft access database engine. ) It can be downloaded from Microsoft. 

2. VBO (Visual Business Object - The adapter used to connect to an application)
Once the OLEDB DLL is installed, ensure that the VBO is imported correctly into blue Prism 


Standard OLEDB usage:
-Set connection: The OLEDB. Connection string must be set in the VBO. 

OLEDB has 5 actions 

Set connection - will need to provide Database, Password, Provider, Connect String 
Open connection- This will open the connection, which makes the target file available for OLEDB queries and operations. 
Get Collection-  Execution of an SQL statement in OLEDB to get the data collection. 



Execute - Execute one or more SQL statements in OLEDB. This can be used to write data to a worksheet.

Close - When finished, you must close the OLEDB connection to correctly finalize operations. 


SQL direct when using OLEDB 
OLEDB uses a subset of SQL from Microsoft Access, not the full SQL implementation 
Delete statements do not function. 
Drop table statements work to remove all data from a table, but will not drop the table itself.
