What is six sigma ?
Tools and techniques
Six sigma aims to reduce time, defects and variability

DMAIC 
Define - what issues you are facing/ opportunity for improvement/ what the customer requirements are. Look at the process as a whole.
Measure - how is the process performing now/ 
Analyze - what causes the problem or variation.
Improve - 
Control - make regular adjustment to improve. 
Thanks to 6 sigma you can produce an defect free product 99.9996b% of the time.

DMADV/ DFSS
Define- what are the requirements, data, research. 
Measure- use customer requirements to make a specification (it helps define the product in a measurable method) so data can be compared to specific requirements. 
Analyze- you analyze the product to look at better ways to achieve the required result. Areas of improvement are made and tested.
Design- based on the learning from the analysis phase the new process or product is designed. (Then perform the analyze method again)/ focus group

Verify- check if product meets or exceeds customer requirements. 

Lean- removes any part of the process that is not beneficial to the customer. Doing more with less while doing it better.
